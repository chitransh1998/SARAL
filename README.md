About Covid-19 response

## Background: 
About, 20,000 people stranded across the nation due to the lockdown belonging to Bokaro
District. Bokaro district is in the state of Jharkhand, India with a population of about 25 Lakhs divided
into two subdivisions, 9 blocks and 250 panchayats. These stranded people included labour,
medical migrants, tourists, students etc. After the MHA guidelines, it was now possible for
these people to be transported back to their native places. The main challenge was to plan
the arrival of these people back into the district safely and also ensure their surveillance.

## Overview
A system was designed to plan rescue operations for stranded migrants and
efficiently record details of the incoming migrants for further surveillance and planning
of relief measures.

## Data Collection
1. ##### Incoming Migrant Data:
   A digital form was created that captured personal details, skill information, and travel history of migrants, and field staff at 20 entry points into the district like railway stations and highways were trained to fill this form.   
2. #### Stranded Migrant Data:
  Call centers were set up to receive information on migrants stuck at various locations in the nation.   
3. #### Demographic data of the region was obtained from ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute).
